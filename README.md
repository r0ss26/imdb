 A challenge for the holiday

* Guess what...time to create another rails app!
* Create a new app, called imdb, using postgresql as our database

* Create the routes to make a full CRUD resource for movies
    * Not using resource ... actually writing them out

* Create a controller for movies, with all necessary methods
* Use yesterday's starter code to save a variable @movies to our session

* Create the views for movies
* For CREATE and UPDATE, we will need to implement a form!

* We should be able to:
    * view all movies
    * view one movie
    * update a movie
    * delete a movie

Advanced:
* After completing the CRUD resource, make it look pretty with some styling

Expert:
* Already done? Add in another CRUD resource for actors
